# Final Grade Calculator

This is a final grade calculator that will calculate a final course grade based upon user input.
To use this application, run the program in a Python compatible IDE and follow the prompts. The program will ask for the course name, the number of course categories, the names of the course categories, and the weights of the course categories. It will then ask the user for the number of grades within each category, which will prompt a user input of those grades.
